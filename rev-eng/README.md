# Reverse Engineering

This folder contains writeups for **Reverse Engineering** challenges involving analyzing and understanding compiled programs without source code.

## Scope

Reverse engineering involves:
- Understanding how programs work internally
- Analyzing compiled binaries and executables
- Recovering algorithms and logic from machine code
- Understanding program behavior and functionality
- Identifying vulnerabilities and security flaws
- Recreating or modifying program functionality

## Common Challenge Types

- **Crackmes** - Programs designed to be reverse engineered
- **Keygenning** - Creating license key generators
- **Malware Analysis** - Understanding malicious software behavior
- **Algorithm Recovery** - Understanding proprietary algorithms
- **Obfuscated Code** - Analyzing intentionally obfuscated programs
- **Packed Executables** - Analyzing compressed/encrypted binaries
- **Anti-Debugging** - Bypassing anti-debugging techniques
- **Code Patching** - Modifying program behavior

## Common Techniques

- **Static Analysis** - Analyzing code without execution
- **Dynamic Analysis** - Running and monitoring program behavior
- **Disassembly** - Converting machine code to assembly
- **Decompilation** - Converting assembly to higher-level code
- **Debugging** - Step-by-step program execution analysis
- **API Analysis** - Understanding function calls and libraries

## Tools Used

- **Disassemblers**: IDA Pro, Ghidra, radare2, x64dbg
- **Debuggers**: GDB, x64dbg, OllyDbg, WinDbg
- **Decompilers**: Ghidra, Hex-Rays, RetDec
- **Analysis Tools**: strings, objdump, file, PEiD
- **Packing Tools**: UPX, PEiD, Detect It Easy
