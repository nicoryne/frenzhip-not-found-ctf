# Binary Exploitation (PWN)

This folder contains writeups for **Binary Exploitation** challenges, commonly referred to as "pwn" challenges.

## Scope

Binary exploitation involves finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in compiled programs to:
- Gain unauthorized access to systems
- Execute arbitrary code
- Escalate privileges
- Bypass security mechanisms

## Common Challenge Types

- **Buffer Overflows** - Stack/heap-based buffer overflows
- **Format String Vulnerabilities** - Exploiting printf-style functions
- **ROP/JOP** - Return-oriented programming and jump-oriented programming
- **Heap Exploitation** - Use-after-free, double-free, heap spraying
- **Shellcode** - Writing and executing custom shellcode
- **ASLR/Bypass** - Defeating address space layout randomization
- **Stack Canaries** - Bypassing stack protection mechanisms

## Tools Used

- **Debuggers**: GDB, pwndbg, gef
- **Disassemblers**: IDA Pro, Ghidra, radare2
- **Exploit Frameworks**: pwntools, ROPgadget
- **Analysis Tools**: checksec, file, strings, objdump
