## üß† Challenge Description

> Can you try to get the flag? Beware we have PIE!

---

## üìÅ Provided Files / Access

- Service: `nc rescued-float.picoctf.net [port]`
- File:  `vuln.c`
- Binary: `vuln`

---

## üß™ Approach & Strategy

### Goal

Find the flag by calling the function that prints the address. But how do you call the function?

### Tools / Techniques

List tools or concepts used. For example:

- C Memory Addresses
- Hexadecimal Arithmetic

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-step Solution

1. When running `nc rescued-float.picoctf.net [port]`, you will be shown this screen.
   
   ![pietime_1](./Images/pietime_1.png)
   When inputting a string of numbers, you get a segfault message. 
   
   ![pietime_2](./Images/pietime_2.png)
   It doesn't tell us much other than we need an address to get to somewhere. Let's see if opening the code helps us somehow.

2. Opening the file, we can see a win function that opens a `flag.txt` file. 
   
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void segfault_handler() {
  printf("Segfault Occurred, incorrect address.\n");
  exit(0);
}

int win() {
  FILE *fptr;
  char c;

  printf("You won!\n");
  // Open file
  fptr = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
  if (fptr == NULL)
  {
      printf("Cannot open file.\n");
      exit(0);
  }

  // Read contents from file
  c = fgetc(fptr);
  while (c != EOF)
  {
      printf ("%c", c);
      c = fgetc(fptr);
  }

  printf("\n");
  fclose(fptr);
}

int main() {
  signal(SIGSEGV, segfault_handler);
  setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0); // _IONBF = Unbuffered

  printf("Address of main: %p\n", &main);
  unsigned long val;
  printf("Enter the address to jump to, ex => 0x12345: ");
  scanf("%lx", &val);
  printf("Your input: %lx\n", val);

  void (*foo)(void) = (void (*)())val;
  foo();
}
```
   
   Since we know it reveals the address of the main function each time, we can tell that we need to find the memory address of the win function.

3. I ran this on an online C compiler and tried printing the address of `win()` along with the main function.

4. Seeing the hexadecimal difference between addresses of `main()` and `win()`, we get **8A**.

5. All we have to do now is take the address of main from the netcat and subtract 8A from it to get the flag.
